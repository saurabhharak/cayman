# Project: Map2LGD LGD Mapping Appüåêüó∫Ô∏è

**Description:**

Map2LGD is not just an app; it's an exploration of data-driven cartography. This LGD (Local Government Directory) Mapping App redefines the process of mapping LGD codes across India's diverse administrative levels. Whether you're a seasoned researcher, a meticulous data analyst, or someone captivated by India's geography, Map2LGD transforms mapping into an intuitive and seamless experience.

## Basic Information

- **Objective:** Facilitate the mapping of LGD codes for states, districts, sub-districts, blocks, gram panchayats, and villages in India.
- **Features:**
  - Streamlined mapping process for various administrative levels.
  - Dynamic handling of unmatched names by updating variations for accurate mapping.

## Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Streamlit

## Architecture

The Map2LGD app follows a modular architecture, combining the power of Python and the Streamlit library. From import statements to page routing, main app logic, mapping functions, and utility functions, each component contributes to an engaging and efficient mapping experience.

## Web Interface

Crafted with Streamlit's magic, the web interface is not just a UI; it's a journey. Buttons, file uploaders, data displays, and interactive elements guide users seamlessly through the mapping process.


## Key Achievements

- Successfully streamlined the mapping process for diverse administrative levels.
- Implemented a robust system for handling unmatched names, enhancing the accuracy of mapping.
